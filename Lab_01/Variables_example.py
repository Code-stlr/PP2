# example 1
x = 5
y = "Ehsan"
print(x)
print(y)

# example 2 
x = 4       # x is of type int
x = "Ehsan" # x is now of type str
print(x)

# example 3 Casting 
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

# example 4 Type 
x = 5
y = "Ehsan"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))

#Example 5 Case Sensitive 
a = 4
A = "Ehsan"
    #A will not overwrite a
